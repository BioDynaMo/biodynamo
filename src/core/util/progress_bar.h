/// progress of a simulation.
///
/// The progress bar is printed to the terminal and looks like this:
/// 100% [====================] 1000/1000 0.0s
///
/// The progress bar is updated every time the function `Step` is called in the
/// scheduler.
///
/// The progress bar is not visible if the simulation output is written to a
/// file.
///
/// Relevant parameters:
/// - `Param::progress_bar_time_unit` (default: "s")
/// - `Param::use_progress_bar` (default: false)
