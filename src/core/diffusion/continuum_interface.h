/// @brief Continuum class to interface with BioDynaMo for hybrid simulations.
///
/// This class is used to interface arbitrary Continuum implementations with
/// BioDynaMo. The continuum may be a single- or multi-threaded, or possibly
/// even a GPU implementation. Furthermore, it can be of arbitrary
/// dimension. We provide more specific interfaces for scalar and vector fields
/// (see `ScalarField` and `VectorField`). The interface is pure virtual, thus,
/// the user must implement the methods (`Initialize`, `Update`, `Step`) in the
/// derived class. The `DiffusionGrid` class is an example of such a derived
/// class implementing a continuum (scalar field) via a finite difference
/// discretization for the diffusion equation. Another example is given in the
/// demo `analytic_continuum` which attaches an analytic scalar field to the
/// simulation.
///
/// The class is included into the BioDynaMo simulation scheme through the
/// `ContinuumOp` class. This class is a stand-alone operation, i.e., it is
/// called once per simulation step (if its frequency is 1). This call to the
/// `ContinuumOp::operator()` method triggers the execution of the
/// `IntegrateTimeAsynchronously` method, which in turn calls the `Step` method
/// with appropriate time step(s). Note that there are two options to influence
/// the synchronisation of the simulation: the frequency of the `ContinuumOp`
/// and the time step of the `Continuum`. The former defines the synchronization
/// frequency between ABM and the continuum. The latter defines the time step of
/// the continuum. Note that the scheduler passes a time step of 0 to the
/// ContinuumOp in the first simulation step, which does not call back to Step
/// in this case. Thus, Step() is called in the second time step the earliest
/// (later for higher frequencies).
