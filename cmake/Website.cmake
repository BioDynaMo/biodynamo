# For website-live the Doxygen files are not generated because we expect users
# to mostly be interested in how the markdown files will look like. There is
# also some bug in trying to show the API files if you were to enable to it
# (i.e. it doesn't resolve the path correctly). For those that want to see the
# Doxygen output, you can open the index.html in the build/doc/api directory with
# your browser
