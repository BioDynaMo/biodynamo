## What is BioDynaMo?

BioDynaMo is a software platform to easily create, run, and visualise 3D agent-based simulations.
* **Blazing fast:** The core of the platform is written in C++ and is highly optimized to harness the computational power of modern hardware.
* **Modular:** Reuse, adapt, or create modules that represents a specific biological behavior or entity. With BioDynaMo you don't need to start from scratch anymore!
* **Visual:** Effortlessly create astonishing images and animations of your simulations. Your publications and presentations will stand out even more!

## Installation

Simply run the following command:

```
curl https://biodynamo.org/install | bash
```

For more information, check out our [user's guide](https://www.biodynamo.org/user-guide) documentation that is designed for people who will use BioDynaMo on a day-to-day basis, and aims at providing users with all essential info to make full use of BioDynaMo.

<!-- ## Examples
-- Show some nice visualizations here, with a one-liner explanation -->

## Contributing

The main purpose of this repository is to evolve BioDynaMo, making it faster and easier to use. Development of BioDynaMo happens in the open on Github, and we are grateful to the community for contributing bugfixes and improvements. Please read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/BioDynaMo/biodynamo/blob/master/doc/dev_guide/contribute.md) and learn about our development process, how to propose bugfixes and improvements, and how to build and test your changes to BioDynaMo.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community in BioDynaMo. Thus, we expect all contributors to adhere to our [covenant for contributors](https://www.biodynamo.org/developer-guide/contributor-covenant).

## Citation

When publishing work that relies on BioDynaMo, please cite the following manuscripts, which underwent rigorous peer review. 
Citations are crucial to improve your work's reproducibility, show funding agencies that our work is valuable to the community, and increase your peers' knowledge about our terrific tool.

We recommend specifying the exact BioDynaMo version used in the methods section. 
For example: 

``` latex
We use BioDynaMo v1.04.5-e9db03a1 \cite{breitwieser_biodynamo_2022, breitwieser_biodynamo_2023} 
for all simulations in this article. 
```

The version can be obtained by executing `biodynamo --version` and can be interpreted as follows: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-SHA` 
`SHA` is the git commit hash that can be used to check out the exact BioDynaMo version with `git checkout SHA`.
