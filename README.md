## What is BioDynaMo?

BioDynaMo is a software platform to easily create, run,
and visualise 3D agent-based biological simulations.
* **Blazing fast:** The core of the platform is writen in C++ and is highly optimized to harness the computational power of modern hardware.
* **Modular:** Reuse, adapt, or create modules that represents a specific biological behavior or entity. With BioDynaMo you don't need to start from scratch anymore!
* **Visual:** Effortlessly create astonishing images and animations of your simulations. Your publications and presentations will stand out even more!
