# Runs clang-tidy in the given directory
# Arguments:
#   $1 - Path to the clang-tidy binary
#   $2 - Path to the clang-tidy header helper source file
#   $3 - Path to the compile_commands.json to use
#   $4 - Mode (0, 1, or 2)
#        0: raise an error if there were warnings
#        1: apply fixes
#        2: display warnings
#   $ARGN - Files that should be tested

# Unlike clang-format, clang-tidy cannot be executed on a header file alone.
# It requires a translation unit TU (*.cc) = source file.
# However, if we want to test a list of header files we do not know which source
# file to choose.
# Therefore, we generate a source file (parameter $3) which includes them
