Enabling visualization is very easy. BioDynaMo can be configured through its own
configuration file: `bdm.toml`. Visualization is just one of the many configuration
options. Let's take a look at how to set it. We shall continue using the `hello_world`
example from the previous exercise.

## Create the configuration file

In your simulation directory `hello_world` create a new file called `bdm.toml`.
You can also do this from the command line with the following command:

``` sh
touch bdm.toml
```

## Export visualization files

One way to enable visualization is to export a visualization file every time step
(or every N time steps). In the `bmd.toml` file add the following lines:

```
[visualization]
export = true
export_interval = 1

	[[visualize_sim_object]]
	name = "Cell"
	additional_data_members = [ "diameter_" ]

```

This will export a visualization file every time step. You can set the frequency
by setting the `export_interval`. Make sure that you run a good number of steps
so that the cells have time to divide. Set it to around 2000 for the `hello_world` example.
You can do this in `src/hello_world.h` in the `scheduler.Simulate(time_steps)` function.
Run your simulation with `biodynamo run`.

Now we need to open ParaView:

!!! warning
	Make sure you start ParaView from the project directory. Otherwise, ParaView might not find the exported files.

``` sh
paraview
```

Select "File->Load State" as shown below:

![ParaView Load State](images/pv_load_state.png)

Navigate to your simulation output directory and select the `pvsm` file.

![ParaView Select *.pvsm](images/pv_load_state_2.png)

In the next window keep the default (_Use File Names From State_) and click OK.

<!-- ## Live visualization

Another way to enable visualization is through ParaView's live visualization.
This feature allows you to inspect your simulation while it is running. In your
`bdm.toml` file you add the following lines:

```
[visualization]
live = true
```
