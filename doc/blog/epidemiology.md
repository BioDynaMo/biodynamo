In addition to cellular studies (tumour growth modelling or neural development), BioDynaMo can be used to simulate larger systems, such as groups of people and their interactions.

In these simulations, BioDynaMo is used to study spreading of viruses in closed and environments. Several scenarios are investigated, such as public transports (bus, metro) or buildingsâ€™ indoor (supermarket, office).
To do so, BioDynaMo is in charge of simulating the behaviour and characteristics of individuals, while the ROOT framework (https://root.cern.ch/) simulates the precise geometry of the environment. Each individual can then independently move around in their environment, while infected individuals can contaminate healthy ones through the spreading of droplets and aerosols.

Different conditions will be tested depending on the measures taken to limit virus spreading (such as social distancing or wearing masks).
Thanks to these simulations, we hope to better understand the mechanisms influencing virus spreading in closed environment, and to determine efficient measures to limit contamination between individuals.
