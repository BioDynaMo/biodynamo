## Flocking Algorithm
This [Flocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocking_(behavior)) algorithm builds on the framework established by R. Olfati-Saber in his paper ["Flocking for multi-agent dynamic systems: algorithms and theory"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1605401?arnumber=1605401).  
Boids try to match their velocity with neighboring boids and keep a desired distance to them. A common group objective can be set towards which the boid should migrate.   
At each computational step an internal acceleration for each boid is computed and it's velocity and position updated accordingly. The acceleration consists of two terms that get added in a priority based scheme: the flocking force and a steering force towards the group objective. The flocking force is the (weighted) sum of three input terms:  
 - a term that tries to match the boid's velocity with neighboring boids  
 - a term that tries to keep a desired distance between a boid and its neighbors  
 - a term that improves the overall flock cohesion 

## Simulation
At the start of the simulation, all boids spawn uniformly at random inside a starting sphere centered at the domain's origin. All boids have no initial velocity and a random heading direction. By default the domain is an open torus.  
To visualize the simulation, import the output in paraview and set the boids' scale array to ```actual_diameter```.

## Running the Simulation

Before running the simulation, increase the number of simulation steps in 
`bdm.json` to a larger number, we suggest 
```json
{
 ... ,
 "bdm::SimParam": {
    ...
    "computational_steps": 8000,
    ...
  }
}
```
Instead of the default value `200`. To start the simulation, simply execute 
```
bdm run
```
in the shell in your project folder. Note that you can change the parameters to 
explore the parameter space in `bdm.json` without the need to recompile the 
simulation. To visualize the results, type 
```
paraview
```
in your terminal (again while being in the project folder). One may then load
the results via 
```
File > Load State > "output/flocking_simulation/flocking_simulation.pvsm" 
> "Use File Names form States"
```
By default, the boid's vision radius (`diameter`) is shown. The overlapping 
illustrates that the boids can sense each other. For a more classical 
visualization of the flocking behavior, click `Boids` in the `pipeline browser` 
and select `actual_diameter` (scale array) in the tab `properties (Boids)` 
(left). The `Play` button on the top right shows the results over time.

## Extensions to this project

The original implementation of the demo can be found in this 
(GitHub repository)[https://github.com/mhoghrab/biodynamo-flocking-simulation].
It contains further extensions to the project such as obstacle avoidance and 
perturbations via a random field.
